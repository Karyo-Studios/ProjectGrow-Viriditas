==== Change Render Pipeline ====

To change render pipeline to Universal RP or Basic RP, please do the following:

1.) Under the Davis3D/AlienPlantsVol3 Folder, Delete these folders and their contents
- Materials
- Meshes
- Prefabs
- Scenes
- Scripts
- Shaders
- Sounds

(You'll notice that this is everything except for the "Textures" folder)


2.) Extract your chosen unitypackage patch file

--BasicRP Patch--
--URP Patch--

3.) If installing Basic RP, please ensure that the Color Space is set to Linear.
You can do this by going to Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering > Color Space

====Screen Space Reflections====

If you are using HDRP, and want the water looking like the screenshots on the product page, be sure to enable screen space reflections in your HDRP Pipeline Asset.

To do this, open your "HD Render Pipeline Asset"
scroll down to "Lighting"
Under "Reflections", make sure to tick these two boxes:
- Screen Space Reflection
- Transparent
